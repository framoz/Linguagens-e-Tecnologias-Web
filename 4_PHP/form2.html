    <!-- 
    FORM EXPLANATION:
    - <form> element defines an HTML form
    - action="sum2.php" tells the browser where to send the form data (which file will process it)
    - method="GET" specifies that form data should be sent as URL parameters
      (e.g., sum2.php?num1=5&num2=10)
    - If we used method="POST", the data would be sent in the HTTP request body instead
      and we would access it with $_POST['num1'] in PHP
    -->
    <form action="sum2.php" method="GET">
        <div>
            <!-- 
            Label elements improve accessibility and UX by associating text with input fields
            The 'for' attribute connects the label to the input field with matching 'id'
            -->
            <label for="num1">First Number:</label>
            
            <!-- 
            Input field for the first number:
            - type="number" makes this accept only numeric input (and shows up/down arrows)
            - id="num1" connects this input to its label
            - name="num1" is the parameter name that will be sent to PHP ($_GET['num1'])
            - required makes this field mandatory (form can't be submitted without a value)
            -->
            <input type="number" id="num1" name="num1" required>
        </div>

        </div>
        
        <div style="margin-top: 20px;">
            <!-- 
            Submit button:
            - type="submit" makes this button submit the form when clicked
            - When clicked, the browser collects all form inputs and sends them to sum2.php
            -->
